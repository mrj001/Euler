; The screen is cleared.
; This test should print "HELLO, WORLD!" on the first line of the screen
; The second line of the screen should be filled with the digits 0 through 
; 9 repeated 4 times.
; The third line should say "THIRD LINE"
; Note that the "READY" line will be further down the screen as we are
; not updating BASIC's idea of where the cursor is.
